A Simple - Yet Quite Powerful - Palette Quantizer Library
=========================================================
Converted to a class library by Leonard T. Erwine, October, 2014.

This contains source code which was taken from a Code Project Article and modified as a class library.
A bug was discovered in the Octre quantizer, which I fixed using locking and thread-safe collections from the LTEToolkitLibrary C# project.

Dependency Information
----------------------

The modifications to this project depend upon thread-safe collections which exist in the LTEToolKitLibrary project.

Summary of modifications
------------------------

- Changed root namespace from "SimplePaletteQuantizer" to "Rimss.GraphicsProcessing.Palette" to make it uniform with the rest of the solution.

- Encountered frequent System.NullReferenceException errors due to null nodes existing in the Levels collections
	(Quantizers/Octree/OctreeQuantizer.cs, Method: OnGetPalette, while ording the level nodes by pixel presence). It did not seem that having null nodes in those
	collections was a desired behavior, so I modified Quantizers/Octree/OctreeQuantizer.cs to use thread-safe collections for the root node and level node collections.
	Also, since the level node collection was of a fixed length, changed it to use a read-only thread-safe collection.
	Lastly, I added a call to Thread.Sleep after a new root node was created, to give other threads a chance to catch up, in case this was the cause
	of the System.NullReferenceException error.
